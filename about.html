                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>
                            I am a 23-year-old computer engineering student at the University of Alberta.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I like lifting weights, relaxing, financial markets, philosophy, and any form of healthy competition. If you can relate, send me an email because I love to make new friends!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here's a photo of me, seconds away from savagely brutalizing a kid at his first meet up (double 4-stock if you actually play Melee). Poor kid didn't even know the rules, so I let him choose an illegal stage (Pok√© Floats) before showing him the hard knock life. It was all in good spirits though, and after some laughter, it was a fistbump and GGs.
                        </p>
